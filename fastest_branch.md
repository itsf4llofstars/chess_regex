# Fastest Parsers

A git branch to find the fastest and most efficient way to parse<br>
large pgn file.<br>

## Parser Code and Branch Layout

Each Python code block will be in the src/main.py file and be comprised<br>
of all functions, or straight line (no functions) code. The utilization<br>
of as much or as little of regular expression will be explored. Each fully-<br>
functioning parser will be tagged in the branch.
